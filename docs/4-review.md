## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Social IMPLICATION

I designed the To-Do List app to help users manage their tasks. The simple and clear interface makes it easy for people can use it comfortably. By improving task management and reducing stress, the app supports positive lifestyle habits and helps users feel more in control of their tasks.


### Ethical IMPLICATION 

I made the app respects user privacy. It does not collect or share any personal information, and all data is only can be edited by a user. I ensure the app promotes responsiable and ethical use.


### Usability IMPLICATION

The design focused on ease of use, with clear interface and simple buttons for adding, editing, and deleting tasks. I used high colour visibility and readable text to make the app accessible for users with visual difficulties. These choices make it easier for everyone to read, understand, and use the app efficiently.


### Accessibility IMPLICATION

I included features that make the app usable for everyone, including people with visual or cognitive difficulties. Users can choose their favourite colour themes to improve readability and comfort. The clear layout, large buttons, and readable fonts make the app accessible to users of all ages and abilities, ensuring an inclusive experience.


### Health & Safety IMPLICATION

I considered user wellbeing when designing the app. The interface uses calming green and a clean layout to reduce visual strain and stress. By helping users organise tasks effectively, the app supports positive mental health and reduces anxiety related to task management. It also encourages healthy workâ€“life balance by allowing users to set reminders and manage their safely and efficiently.

## Overall Review

I created a great To-Do app. It helps to manage tasks. Users can categorise tasks into groups by type, and each task can be assigned a priority, picture, colour, and due date. Furthermore, a checkmark can be added to indicate whether a task is completed. This makes it easy to see which tasks are finished and which are still pending. This system doesn't have notifications such as reminders, so user must open the app and see their tasks. This To-Do app exists to support users. Various patterns were used to add groups/tasks, ensuring no errors occurred throughout the entire process. Various patterns were also used during editing, ensuring no errors occurred during the process of approving changes. This ensures a comfortable experience for users when using this application and prevents situations where the application becomes unusable due to errors. I will be able to make the application better to add a notification to remind users of tasks. If the application has a notification, it could prevent fail to finish tasks, even the users do not open the application.

Replace these words with a brief review of how the project went in terms of:
- What went well?
- What didn't go so well?
- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system?
- What would you do differently if you could?
