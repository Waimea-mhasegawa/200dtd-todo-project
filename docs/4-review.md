## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Social IMPLICATION

I designed the To-Do List app to help users manage their tasks. The simple and clear interface makes it easy for people can use it comfortably. By improving task management and reducing stress, the app supports positive lifestyle habits and helps users feel more in control of their tasks.


### Ethical IMPLICATION 

I made the app respects user privacy. It does not collect or share any personal information, and all data is only can be edited by a user. I ensure the app promotes responsiable and ethical use.


### Usability IMPLICATION

The design focused on ease of use, with clear interface and simple buttons for adding, editing, and deleting tasks. I used high colour visibility and readable text to make the app accessible for users with visual difficulties. These choices make it easier for everyone to read, understand, and use the app efficiently.


### Accessibility IMPLICATION

I included features that make the app usable for everyone, including people with visual or cognitive difficulties. Users can choose their favourite colour themes to improve readability and comfort. The clear layout, large buttons, and readable fonts make the app accessible to users of all ages and abilities, ensuring an inclusive experience.


### Health & Safety IMPLICATION

I considered user wellbeing when designing the app. The interface uses calming green and a clean layout to reduce visual strain and stress. By helping users organise tasks effectively, the app supports positive mental health and reduces anxiety related to task management. It also encourages healthy workâ€“life balance by allowing users to set reminders and manage their safely and efficiently.
