# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

A functional system means everything works the way it should. All features must run properly, the information shown to users needs to be correct, and the system shouldn’t crash or behave in unexpected ways. The system should do what it was designed to do without errors.

### Relevance to the System

Functionality is very important for a task management because users rely on it to stay organized and keep track of their work. If the system doesn’t function correctly, tasks might not save or reminders could be missed, which would make the app unreliable. When this happens, users may lose trust and stop using it. Making sure the app is fully functional ensures that users can depend on it to manage their daily tasks effectively.

### Impact / Considerations

I need to make sure that every part of the system works properly and does what it’s supposed to do. To achieve this, I will thoroughly test the app using different types of input and scenarios. This testing will help identify any errors or issues so they can be fixed before the app is used by others.


## Usability

A system refers how easy and effective it is for a user to achieve their goals with the app. A usable system should be simple and clear. Good useability is be able to achieve the goal without frustration.

### Relevance to the System

It is important for a task management because it directly impacts a product's success by making it easy for users to complete tasks, leading to increased satisfaction, efficiency, and loyalty. 

### Impact / Considerations

To make the app more usable, I need to design a clear and simple interface with easily recognizable buttons for navigation. It will be used to guide users toward actions. I will test to identify any elements that are confusing of difficult to use. This testing will help ensuring that the final app is simple, efficient, and enjoyable for everyone.



## Aesthetics

A aesthetics mean a strategic approach to designing the app's visual appearance to make it visually pleasing and user-friendly. 

### Relevance to the System

It is important for a task management system because users interact with the system. a clean and visually design helps users concentrate on their tasks and encourages daily use. If the interface looks confusing, users might feel frustrated or difficulty and then may stop using the system. Onthe other hand, an aesthetically design helps creating positive emotional to users.

### Impact / Considerations

I wiil focus on maintaining a consistent visual style across all pages. This includes using a harmonious colour palette and readable fonts. I will also make it simple and balance and avoid visual confusing. Through testing, I will identify design elements that possible to confuse and edit it to improve visibility. A visually organised interface makes system more enjoyable.


## Accessibility

Accessibility means that everyone can use a system effectively. Text should be readable, buttons and links should be easy to identify and use, and color choices should not prevent anyone from understanding the content.

### Relevance to the System

Accessibility is important for a management system because users with different needs must all be able to manage their tasks efficiently. If the system is not accessible, making the application difficult. By ensuring accessibility, the system becomes inclusive, allowing everyone to stay organized.

### Impact / Considerations

I will check the system meets accessibility standards and is easy to use for everyone. I will follow accessibility guidelines and test the system with thinking ease of use for all users. 



## Health and Safety

Health and safety means that protecting users from any risks while using the system. It doesn't just mean phycial safety, but also degital in digital system. A safe system should protect user data, prevent stress or eye strain from from poor design and ensure users can use the app any negative effects on their health. 

### Relevance to the System

It is important for a system because some users spend long times with it to plan and organise their tasks. If the interface is complex, uses too vivd colours or it is difficult to read, it could cause eye strain or frustration. The app must protect user information to prevent privacy risk. A system that considers health and safety helps users feel comfortable, secure, and confident while using it.

### Impact / Considerations

I will design the interface with appropriate colours, readable fonts, and a layout that reduces eye strain to support health and safety. I will also ensure the app includes system that encourage healthy use, such as editable group/task colours. I store data in trustable database to protect user information. By considering both physical comfort and digital safety, the app will provide a secure and user-friendly experience for all users.
