# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

If you have any tasks in daily, it need to be organised and scheduled to prevent missing the tasks. Remembering what tasks/plans you have.

It is a kind of To-Do list.

## End-User Requirements

The typical end-user would be someone who wants to manage all their tasks/plans. They may have just one task, or they may have several. In other words, this system must cater to people with various types of tasks—it must be able to categorise tasks and be concise and visually clear.


## Proposed Solution
A system that allows someone to see manageable tasks for users as family.

- Show a list of tasks that need to be done
- Allow new groups/tasks to be added
- Know the due of the task
- Tasks can be marked as completed
- Tasks can edit

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

A functional system means everything works the way it should. All features must run properly, the information shown to users needs to be correct, and the system shouldn’t crash or behave in unexpected ways. The system should do what it was designed to do without errors.

### Relevance to the System

Functionality is very important for a task management because users rely on it to stay organized and keep track of their work. If the system doesn’t function correctly, tasks might not save or reminders could be missed, which would make the app unreliable. When this happens, users may lose trust and stop using it. Making sure the app is fully functional ensures that users can depend on it to manage their daily tasks effectively.

### Impact / Considerations

I need to make sure that every part of the system works properly and does what it’s supposed to do. To achieve this, I will thoroughly test the app using different types of input and scenarios. This testing will help identify any errors or issues so they can be fixed before the app is used by others.


## Usability

A system refers how easy and effective it is for a user to achieve their goals with the app. A usable system should be simple and clear. Good useability is be able to achieve the goal without frustration.

### Relevance to the System

it is important for a task management because it directly impacts a product's success by making it easy for users to complete tasks, leading to increased satisfaction, efficiency, and loyalty. 

### Impact / Considerations

To make the app more usable, I need to design a clear and simple interface with easily recognizable buttons for navigation. I will test the app with different users to identify any parts that are confusing or hard to use. This testing will help 



## Aesthetics

A aesthetics mean a strategic approach to designing the app's visual appearance to make it visually pleasing and user-friendly. 

### Relevance to the System

It is important for user visually because they directly influence user perception, trust, and behavior. If the system doesn't work, the webpage might br poor visibility, which could make users frustrated. When this happens, users may stop using it.

### Impact / Considerations

I need to
