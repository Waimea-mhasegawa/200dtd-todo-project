# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="400" height="700" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/iILzMl38jYkAkon1egryBJ/Family-To-Do-V1?node-id=1-2&p=f&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Testing

I show the demo to my host mother to get comments/feedback. 

The feedback:
>There is no description of tasks. 

>It's going to better that it has option to select colours for each tasks.

>I would like to attach a picture not only for groups, but also per tasks.

### Changes / Improvements

I updated the UI of the prototype
- I added a page to delete the task/group.
- Add buttons to move setting page with all of them.
- Change it to upload a pic with all of them.
- made a page to write description of the tasks.

Here is the updated UI flow

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.
